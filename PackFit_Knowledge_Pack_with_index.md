### CHUNK 001
**CHUNK ID:** P‑USPS‑PACKAGING‑RULE  
**TARGET SECTION:** POLICIES → USPS Packaging Use  
**RELIABILITY:** High (USPS official)  
**NOTES:** Do not use USPS‑branded boxes/envelopes as “stuffing” inside a poly or to cover/protect other services.  
**Content:**
```
USPS‑provided packaging (Priority Mail, Priority Mail Express, Flat Rate, etc.) must only be used with the matching service. USPS will still charge the matching service price even if markings are covered, removed, or the packaging is cut/reconfigured. Using a USPS Priority box inside a plain poly (for Ground Advantage, UPS, FedEx, etc.) is treated as using USPS Priority packaging and can result in postage due or rejection. USPS also disallows using their free packaging for hazardous or live‑animal shipments unless the matching service is purchased.

**CHUNK ID:** D‑FLOW‑PACKING‑CARRIER  
**TARGET SECTION:** DECISIONING → End‑to‑End Flow

**NOTES:** Single pass decision tree (poly vs box; service choice). Agent should rate‑shop Ground Advantage vs UPS/FedEx automatically.  
**Content (Flow):**

Item Check: fragile? sharp? liquid? compressible? length? girth?

Legal/Policy Gate: if USPS‑branded packaging is present → must use matching USPS class (see P‑USPS‑PACKAGING‑RULE).
USPS FAQs

Soft‑Pack Eligibility: If not fragile, ≤ 20 lb, longest side ≤ 18", and (L+W) ≤ 36" → eligible for USPS Cubic Soft Pack (Priority: up to 0.5 ft³; Ground Advantage: up to 1.0 ft³). Round L & W down to nearest ¼" for cubic tiering.

Box Eligibility: If not soft‑pack eligible or item is fragile → box.

Compute Volumes/Weights:
Cubic volume: (L×W×H)/1728; round each side down to ¼" for USPS cubic.

USPS DIM: if volume > 1 ft³ (1,728 in³), DIM = (L×W×H)/166; round each side to nearest whole inch, result up to next lb.
Postal Explorer +1

UPS DIM: divisor 139 (Daily rates) or 166 (Retail). From Aug 18, 2025 UPS rounds every fractional inch up before DIM.

FedEx DIM: divisor 139; from Aug 18, 2025 FedEx rounds every fractional inch up before DIM.

Surcharges Gate: If >22", >30", or >2 ft³, USPS nonstandard fees may apply; ensure dims are transmitted or a Dimension Noncompliance fee can hit.

USPS Nonstandard Fees may apply if any of the following are true: >22" to 30" length, >30" length, or >2 ft³ (3,456 in³); also certain “characteristics” triggers (e.g., protrusions). USPS can also assess a Dimension Noncompliance fee if required dimensions/ESC are omitted or inaccurate in electronic documentation for qualifying pieces.

**TARGET SECTION:** HEURISTICS → Flat Rate Sweet Spots  
**RELIABILITY:** Medium‑High (USPS official + rule of thumb)  
**NOTES:** Heavy/dense soft goods often win here.  
**Content:**
```
For heavy but small apparel (e.g., jeans/hoodies), test a USPS Priority Padded Flat Rate Envelope (PFRE) (approx 12.5"×9.5"). It often beats weight/DIM for 2–5 lb dense items when they can safely fit flat. Always compare against GA Cubic and UPS/FedEx Ground.

Common small‑box set that avoids DIM traps and fits many SKUs: 8×6×4" (0.11 ft³), 10×8×4" (0.19 ft³), 12×9×4" (0.25 ft³), 10×8×6" (0.28 ft³), 12×10×5" (0.35 ft³). Stock polys (6×9, 10×13, 14.5×19") and padded mailers (6×10, 8.5×12, PFRE). (No citation—operational recommendation.)

PACKING DECISION
- Item: {title} ({item_id})
- Packaging: {poly | box size WxLxH | PFRE}
- Filler/Tape: {bubble | kraft | none} | {H-tape, 3 strips}
- Service: {USPS GA Cubic Tier X | USPS PM Cubic Tier X | USPS GA Weight | UPS Ground | FedEx Ground}
- Billable weight: {n lb}  (DIM?: {yes/no}, divisor {166|139|166-retail})
- Surcharges: {none | USPS nonstandard length | cube}
- Est. cost: ${X.XX}  [why: {short justification}]
- Measurements source: {image_scan|user|assumed} (confidence {0.xx})

Why using a USPS box inside a plain poly is a bad idea (short answer)
Because USPS treats any use of their free branded packaging as use of the service it’s printed for—even if the markings are covered or the box is cut up. The mailpiece can be upcharged to Priority/Express, refused, or returned. That’s why you should never use USPS boxes as “stuffing” or liners for non‑USPS (or non‑matching USPS) shipments.

Last tiny updates your agent should respect

```
Yes — exactly 👌 what you’ve pasted there is Option A (multi-chunk).  Each one starts with the mini-header:  CHUNK ID: TARGET SECTION: RELIABILITY: NOTES:   …then has the Content block.  That’s the best format for your Big Chat folders + Chunk Protocol system because:  Every rule/policy/formula is self-contained.  Easy to replace or add a chunk without breaking the rest.  Your agent can reference specific chunk IDs (“use CHUNK 002 + CHUNK 003 to decide packing”) for accuracy.  Less chance of mistakes since each block has context + reliability notes.

✅ What you have now:  CHUNK 001 → CHUNK 020 = a complete knowledge pack.  It covers USPS rules, DIM formulas, cubic tiering, surcharges, heuristics, API connectors, pseudocode, eBay integration, image measurement, and output templates.  It’s already in the right Chunk Protocol style — so you can paste directly into your Big Chat and slot into your “folders.”

👉 Next step is just organizational:  Drop these chunks under the right folder headings (Policies, Decisioning, Math, Heuristics, Integrations, etc.).  Then when the agent runs, it will “know” where to pull from.  Would you like me to also give you a single consolidated “index” chunk (like a Table of Contents chunk) that just lists all CHUNK ID → TARGET SECTION mappings? That way, your Big Chat can navigate them faster.

This summary covers:

The eBay fee formulas extracted from the eBay Fees Calculator.

Detailed instructions for building your “YABE” custom GPT (handling inputs, category-specific FVF rates, TRS discounts, international fees, etc.).

The PackFit API implementation using FastAPI (including packaging heuristics, DIM rules and non‑standard fees).

Deployment and troubleshooting on Vercel (repo structure, vercel.json configuration, fixing indentation issues, testing /ping and /packfit/estimate).

Next steps and best practices (replacing stubs with the full PackFit logic, connecting your GitHub repo to the GPT, and using proper commit hygiene).

After loading this summary in the main chat, continue by:

Committing the full PackFit logic to api/index.py if it’s not already there.

Ensuring vercel.json routes are correct (choose whether to use a /api prefix or not).

Testing both /ping and /packfit/estimate to confirm live endpoints.

Optionally hooking your GitHub repo to the GPT Builder via the Actions tab for automatic updates.
